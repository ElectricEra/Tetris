# Tetris

This is first working version.
It doesnt look great, but it works.

In next few days it will be much more better, but you can play in now!

If you want to make your own sequences of figures, edit "Figures" file.
There is no limit of different frames or figures.
NOTE! In this version you NEED to make blocks with 4 bricks! Any other number will not work.

All bugs will be fixed soon and UI will be added.

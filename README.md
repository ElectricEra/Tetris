# Tetris

This is first working version.
It doesnt look great, but it works.

In next few days it will be much more better, but you can play in now!

Update 1.0:
If you want to make your own sequences of figures, edit "Figures" file.
There is no limit of different frames or figures.
In this file you can also edit the colot f that tile.

NOTE! You can create any sequence as long as you have same amount of bricks on each frame. You can duplicate brick coordinates to fill unnessecary bricks.
